          when I get to the teaching category - first I will be creating some
          rules as of a teacher and writing summaries/tutorials about school
          maths/physics according to the national education programme in
          Lithuania. After that maybe improve my, as a math and physics tutor,
          work. Everything will be listed in this page.
