          <h1>Currently</h1>
          working on three projects:
          <ul>
            <li>No Point Writings. "Portfolio" website</li>
            <li>
              Caramoi - Hot Caramel Croissants. App for finding hot, just out of
              the oven, caramel croissants in your nearest market
            </li>
            <li>MessG. All in one messaging app</li>
          </ul>
          After that will be working on a TimeLoopCave game, or other games
          (multiplayer, arcade-type). Or learning theory (messaging
          (networking), machine learning )
          <br />
          While building all of that (yeah, I don't have a team yet), I'm
          learning a lot of basics for different programming languages and
          frameworks, but mainly learning about deployment and project
          structure. Therefore I am also building a list of my own development
          standards (basically all my knowledge, except for the basics, will be
          stucturized and put here):
