          While building all of that (yeah, I don't have a team yet), I'm
          learning a lot of basics for different programming languages and
          frameworks, but mainly learning about deployment and project
          structure. Therefore I am also building a list of my own development
          standards (basically all my knowledge, except for the basics, will be
          stucturized and put here):

            My Dev Standards
          </a>
          <br />
          When I will learn enough about deployment and sdlc - I will make a
          team to work on some projects
          <h1>Lifetime idea:</h1>
          <p>
            Make a game that would be played by everyone. Sth like angry birds,
            or flappy bird, or mario, but better. With mind bending story. Maybe
            that would be the TimeLoopCave game?
