      While building all of that (yeah, I don't have a team yet), I'm learning a
      lot of basics for different programming languages and frameworks, but
      mainly learning about deployment and project structure. Therefore I am
      also building a list of my own development standards (basically all my
      knowledge, except for the basics, will be stucturized and put here):

      When I will learn enough about deployment and sdlc - I will make a team to
      work on some projects
      <h1>Lifetime idea:</h1>
      <p>
        Make a game that would be played by everyone. Sth like angry birds, or
        flappy bird, or mario, but better. With mind bending story. Maybe that
        would be the TimeLoopCave game...
